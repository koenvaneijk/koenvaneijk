# Hi, I'm Koen van Eijk üëã

I design and build **autonomous AI agents** that solve complex business problems at scale. I'm a technical founder with a successful exit and a passion for turning advanced AI concepts into tangible business value.

* **üöÄ My Mission:** To help businesses in Belgium and the Benelux leverage AI through a focused, high-impact service.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Proven Track Record:** Founder of **Automagica**, a smart RPA platform acquired by Netcall (LSE:NET) in 2020.
* **üìç Location:** Flanders, Belgium.

> ## Now Open for Business: The Autonomous Agent Kickstarter
>
> I'm now working directly with a select number of clients to deploy custom AI agents. My core offering is a fixed-price, 3-4 week project designed to solve one specific, high-value business problem for your company.
>
> The first step is a paid, 90-minute **"AI Opportunity Roadmap Session"** to diagnose your needs and blueprint a solution together.
