## Hi, I'm Koen üëã

I'm a hands-on technical founder and AI architect. My journey began with founding **Automagica**, where I led the development of a smart automation platform from the ground up, culminating in a successful acquisition by Netcall (LSE:NET). My focus has since evolved to the cutting edge of agentic AI, where I now work directly with businesses to build sophisticated, goal-oriented autonomous systems.

### What Industry Leaders Say

> "Koen's technical acumen, attention to detail, and professionalism made substantial and lasting contributions to our company. His expertise was critical in the seamless integration of his technology into our enterprise platform after the acquisition. We highly recommend him."
>
> **Richard Billington** ‚Ä¢ Chief Technical Officer, **Netcall**

> "Koen is solution-driven, flexible, and highly knowledgeable in the domain of automation. I particularly appreciated his ingenuity in circumventing the bottlenecks created by our client's legacy systems. He has an outstanding work ethic and always met every deadline."
>
> **Thomas De Ruyck** ‚Ä¢ Partner, **KPMG Belgium**
